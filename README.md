Work in progress operating system.

As of right now, it will just print "Hello World" in 15 colours constantly. It does flash pretty quickly, so if you have epilepsy be careful when starting up the kernel. 

The build script will mostly fail on linux computers which do not have the $GCC and $GCC64 environment variables set. This is because the $PATH variable did not work for me.
